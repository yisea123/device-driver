Device tree bindings for FPGA controlled PWMs

Required properties:

 - #pwm-cells:		Should be 2
 - compatible:		Should be "gwi,fpga-pwm"
 - reg:			offset of PWM 


Example:
	/* FPGA on CS2*/
	fpga@2,0 {
		reg = <2 0 0x10000>;

		fpga-pwm: fpga-pwm@0 {
			#pwm-cells = <2>;
			compatible = "gwi,fpga-pwm";
		};
	}
